## Vlasnik project

Used

### Next JS.

Easy routing:

1 The index.js files in our pages directory are automatically routed to the root directory,

2 Create a nested folder structure, routes will also be structured in the same manner,

3 Also accept URL parameters and create dynamic routes using the bracket syntax.

Applications built with Next.js are fast because of Server-side Rendering and Static Generation, providing a smarter way to handle data. Server-side rendering will only be as fast as the server is handling requests.

Import CSS styles from a JavaScript file to be used inline for faster rendering.

Images are resized and served using the best, up-to-date formats like WebP.

For those looking for better SEO, titles and keywords for each page are easy to create.

### Sass

1 It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions, and other values.

2 Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.

3 It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.
